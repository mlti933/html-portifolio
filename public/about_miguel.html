<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Miguel Mattos, and I am a Business Administration student. I was introduced to the introductory concepts of business management during my high school abroad, at an American school in Europe. I did my first year of college in the United States, at Marist College, and then returned to Brazil, where I was able to participate in two internship programs, as well as to continue my studies at Ibmec College.

  My first internship program was at the BackOffice of Genial Investimentos, an investment bank in São Paulo. I worked with the settlement of the purchase and sale of securities between banks, as well as checking these values ​​using Microsoft Excel. I also participated in the preparation of a team proposal for the company's entry into the Metaverse. The proposal was presented to Genial executives using Microsoft Power Point at the end of the internship program.

  The second internship program was carried out at the construction company Canopus, in Belo Horizonte. I worked in the company's controllership, checking the legitimacy of service invoices, and I was also responsible for checking and recording the accounting reports of competing companies that were released during the quarter.
  During my studies, I became interested in the field of data science, and thus, I decided to learn how to program in Python, and how to use it to analyze data in spreadsheets in excel and csv formats, which required me to learn the basic concepts of Machine Learning as well.
